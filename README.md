# TensorLab Skills

TensorLab Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks, focusing on multimedia generation and processing. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, Google DeepMind's Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/home) format.

## How do Skills work?

In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. 

> [!NOTE]
> 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an `AGENTS.md` file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses 'extensions' to define the instructions for your coding agent in a `gemini-extension.json` file. **This repo is compatible with all of them, and more!**

> [!TIP]
> If your agent doesn't support skills, you can use [`agents/AGENTS.md`](agents/AGENTS.md) directly as a fallback.

## Installation

TensorLab skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor.

### Claude Code

1. Register the repository as a plugin marketplace:  
   
```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/bob5-tensorslab/skills
```

2. To install a skill, run:  
   
```
/plugin install <skill-name>@https://github.com/bob5-tensorslab/skills
```

For example:  

```
/plugin install tl-image@https://github.com/bob5-tensorslab/skills
```


## Skills

This repository contains a few skills to get you started. You can also contribute your own skills to the repository.

### Available skills

<!-- This table is auto-generated by scripts/generate_agents.py. Do not edit manually. -->
<!-- BEGIN_SKILLS_TABLE -->
| Name | Description | Documentation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `tl-image` | Generate images using TensorsLab's AI image generation models. Supports text-to-image and image-to-image generation with automatic prompt enhancement, progress tracking, and local file saving. | [SKILL.md](skills/tl-image/SKILL.md) |
| `tl-video` | Generate videos using TensorsLab's AI video generation models. Supports text-to-video and image-to-video generation with automatic prompt enhancement, progress tracking, and local file saving. | [SKILL.md](skills/tl-video/SKILL.md) |
<!-- END_SKILLS_TABLE -->

### Environment Setup

Before using the TensorsLab skills, you need to configure your API key:

You can get your API Key at [TensorsLab Console](https://tensorai.tensorslab.com/).

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:TENSORAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Mac/Linux
export TENSORAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Using skills in your coding agent

Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions:

- "Generate an image of an astronaut on the moon."
- "Animate this scenery picture into a 10s video."

Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding `SKILL.md` instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task.

### Contribute or customize a skill

1. Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `tl-image/`) and rename it.
2. Update the new folder's `SKILL.md` frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill-name
   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
   ---

   # Skill Title
   Guidance + examples + guardrails
   ```
3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.
4. Add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with a concise, human-readable description.
5. Run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/publish.sh
   ```
   to regenerate and validate all generated metadata.
6. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.

### Marketplace

The `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file lists skills with human-readable descriptions for the plugin marketplace. The CI validates that skill names and paths match between `SKILL.md` files and `marketplace.json`, but descriptions are maintained separately: `SKILL.md` descriptions guide when Claude activates the skill, while marketplace descriptions are written for humans browsing available skills.
